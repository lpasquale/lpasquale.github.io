  <p style="margin-right:4.7cm;" > I am assistant professor at <a
   href="http://www.ucd.ie"> University College Dublin</a> at the
    <a href="https://www.cs.ucd.ie/">School of Computer Science</a>. I
    am also a funded investigator at <a
   href="http://www.lero.ie"> Lero</a> - the Irish Software Research
    Centre.<br>
    I lead the Science Foundation
    Ireland SIRG project ForCoPS - Forensics Investigations of
    Cyber-Physical Incidents.</p> 
     
    

<p style="margin-right:4.7cm;">My research interests include
    requirements engineering and adaptive systems. My work has focused
    on using runtime models to engineer complex systems, including
    cyber-physical systems, in order to satisfy their security 
requirements, and ensure that they are forensic-ready and  comply
    with data protection regulations.</p>
